# BayesianAnalysis

Through a Bayesian analysis, we attempt to make sense of the relationship between ballpark and player in an effort to determine the validity of including stadiums in future baseball prediction algorithms. Worked in a team of three, and each of us tackled this topic from a different stance. I answered the question: Do home teams find more success in terms of scoring runs?

I completed the second section of this analysis, answering the question on whether playing at home significantly impacts a teamâ€™s run rate. I began by consolidating game-by-game baseball data from 2017 to 2020  and preparing the dataset for modeling. Using visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, and boxplots, I examined patterns in the data, assessed overdispersion, and explored relationships between the predictors and response variables. I then formalized the analysis by specifying priors for each parameter based on intuition and empirical reasoning, opting for weakly informative distributions to maintain flexibility while incorporating realistic assumptions. Using JAGS, I implemented the model through MCMC methods, initializing parameters thoughtfully and diagnosing convergence with trace plots, autocorrelation plots, and diagnostics like Gelman-Rubin and Geweke tests. To ensure the robustness of the results, I conducted a sensitivity analysis, testing the model with non-informative and fully informed priors alongside the partially informed priors initially used.
